    It's hard to see what's going on in the video, but what I did was take all of
the screens in the studio and connect them to computers that could open a web
browser and then I wrote a web app that would let me stream ASCII graphics to
the windows from a central web server via WebSocket connections, and stream
graphics for each window to the central web server from TouchDesigner. Together
the screens could serve as a large spatially-mapped display. I did it in a
couple of hours late one night alone in the studio just for fun. There is a lot
of room for improvement.
