    Chipped Flow

   <p>
    I have a bazillion DIP chips because years ago a hackerspace was shutting down
and was going to throw out their large collection. I took it off their hands
and have been lugging it around ever since.
   </p>
   <p>
    After coming across it in my studio junk I started thinking about quick projects
that I could do with the parts. I thought it might be fun to lay them out using
a generative system in
    <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/">
     Houdini
    </a>
    . The exercise turned
into an exploration of different packing methods. Also I made a little
procedural DIP chip generator asset in Houdini which was fun.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Convert a baby face to topographical lines
    </li>
    <li>
     Generate ribbons wider than the DIP chips along the lines
    </li>
    <li>
     Use the
     <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/uvlayout.html">
      UV Layout
     </a>
     geo node to pack DIP chips into the ribbons.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Tada:

    Same method but with lines generated from a noise function:

    An interesting failure along the way (using point relax):

    Here was a different approach using a packing method that I learned from
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLgeQUGywaQ">
     this Entagma tutorial video
    </a>
    on a
3D model of my head.
