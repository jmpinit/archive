    Beta Processor NES PPU Bookmarklet
   </h1>
   <p>
    The Beta was a made-up processor used for teaching undergraduate computer
science at MIT. Students in the Computation Structures class (6.004) were
required to build an implementation from scratch out of logic gates and
implement an operating system for it by the end of the class. It was one of my
favorite classes at MIT, because I love programming constrained systems and
found it fascinating and satisfying to build up a computer system from scratch.
   </p>
   <p>
    I became preoccupied with building extensions for the Beta to allow it to be
used for graphics experiments. The simulator we used for class ran as a web
application, so I wrote a bookmarklet which was able to monkey-patch the
simulator code and add a NES-like screen for simple graphics:

    The code can be found on
    <a href="https://github.com/jmptable/beta_nes">
     GitHub
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I also
    <a href="https://github.com/jmptable/gamma">
     wrote an emulator in C for the Beta, which I called
Gamma
    </a>
    . It was supposed to provide
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter">
     CGA-style graphics
    </a>
    and
8 bit PCM sound like an old computer system, but I only got around to
implementing the latter. The emulator design has a few interesting attributes.
Lua can be used to load programs and run code every time an instruction is
executed, which is convenient for testing, debugging, and prototyping UI during
development. It also implements a simple text console in the bottom of the
window and keyboard interrupts.
