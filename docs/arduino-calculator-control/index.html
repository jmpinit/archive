    Texas Instruments graphing calculators have a communication port that allow
them to communicate with external devices. If connected to a computer they can
be remote controlled from a special TI PC application. This is usually just
used to transfer files like applications between the PC and the calculator, but
there is a feature which allows the computer to send keystrokes to remote
control the calculator.

    I thought it would be fun to use this protocol to draw images on the calculator
screen by remote controlling the pen tool in the graph viewer. I implemented
the calculator command protocol on an Arduino and plugged it into the
calculator using a cut link cable. On the Arduino I also implemented a simple
serial protocol so I could send messages to the Arduino from my laptop and they
would cause keypresses to be sent to the calculator. Then I wrote a small Ruby
program to take a black and white image and generate the appropriate keypresses
to draw it on the calculator. It used a flood fill algorithm to plan the path
for the pen so that it could be moved efficiently (the calculator was slow).
