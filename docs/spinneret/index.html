    Manage attention online like spiders do, by building webs.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's good reason to argue that spiders
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-017-1069-7">
     use their webs as an integral part
of their minds
    </a>
    (

    ).
By creating and manipulating webs of their silk they build systems for
modulating their limited attention. When a spider is hungry
    <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.2009.1583">
     it tensions its
web so it can respond more quickly to smaller
prey
    </a>
    . How that works can in part
be explained by
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201401027">
     the acoustics of spider
silk
    </a>
    . Spider silk is an amazing
nanomaterial which happens to have the largest wavespeed range of any known
material, making it ideal for the kind of acoustic filter networks spiders need
to offload some of the sensory analysis problems inherent in the way they catch
prey.
   </p>
   <p>
    Humans are already pretty similar to spiders in this way - we too manage
attention on our personal webs via modulated vibration. The notifications on
our phones let us know when there is content available to prey on. But
ironically, for all the technical spectacle that leads up to our phones buzzing
after something happens online, our tools for managing the direct affect on our
limited attention lags behind those of the humble spider by millions of years.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spinneret is an experiment in treating the most common technological interface
to human attention, buzzing phones, like spiders treat their webs.
   </p>
   <p>
    A 3D physics simulation of a web of strands is used to decide when and how
intensely your phone vibrates. Web services which you would like to receive
notifications from are caught on the periphery of the web and shake when they
have activity to notify you of. You can add and remove strands, supports, and
services. Strands can also be shortened or lengthened, which changes how much
vibration they will filter or carry.

    so it's pretty messy and
probably won't get finished.
   </p>
   <p>
    What's left to do:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Web editing tools for adding and removing strands, supports, and services.
    </li>
    <li>
     Run the Android app in the background
    </li>
    <li>
     Make it run on some cloud
    </li>
    <li>
     Actually listen for notifications from various services
    </li>
   </ul>
