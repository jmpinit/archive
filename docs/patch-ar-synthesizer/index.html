    Patch - AR Synthesizer

   <p>
    Patch was meant to be a hardware modular synthesizer which emulated multiple
synthesizer modules and exposed an AR interface for patching them together with
physically simulated patch cables. A QR code stuck to the surface of the PCB
would lead to a website hosting a JavaScript web app that rendered the
augmented reality layer over the device by tracking the QR code with the camera
on the user's device.
   </p>
   <p>
    The user would be presented with a virtual module bank where they could arrange
modules from a library. By dragging their device around while holding a button
on the screen they would be able to connect the modules with virtual patch
cables.
   </p>
   <p>
    Behind the scenes the application would serialize a description of the modules
the user selected and how the user connected them and then send that data to
the actual Patch synthesizer device. Then the microprocessor on the device
would do DSP to simulate the modules and generate audio out the onboard
headphone jack.
   </p>
   <p>
    A key feature was that once the user had patched together the modules to their
liking they would be stored on the device itself. So it could be configured and
then used as a standalone pocket portable musical instrument.
   </p>
   <p>
    I designed and fabricated the PCB but got bogged down in programming the DSP
code on the AVR microprocessor I used. It was overly ambitious but a project
where I learned a lot.
