    I have always been a hoarder of junk. I love the possibilities represented in
junked machines. Digging through a junk pile is a great way to get inspired.
And sometimes you get lucky and find just the part you need for what you are
working on.

   <p>
    At various points I've tried to use or build systems to organize my junk
collection so it would be more useful to me. I made my first attempt at
building one of these systems when I was in middle school. I called it JunkDB.
It was a crappy CRUD application written in PHP. It was fun to work on but I
never really used it intensively because of the prohibitive time cost of
entering the information about my junk collection into its database.
