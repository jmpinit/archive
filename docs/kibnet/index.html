    In high school I had this idea for a physical social network. Every participant
would have a hardware device that let them connect to the network. It wouldn't
use the Internet - devices would communicate peer-to-peer and distribute
messages opportunistically when people with the devices passed near enough to
each other in real life.

    A unique and silly feature of the idea was that the devices would be based on
the TI graphing calculators that all students had to have. The thinking being
that it would reduce the cost of the device, because it would just plug into
the calculator and provide the smarts for communicating with the network while
the calculator would provide the interface and run a lot of the complex code.

    To improve the network I thought about making small server boxes that could
act as network hubs. The devices of people passing by would drop off some
messages and pick some up and hopefully that would boost the likelihood that a
given message would reach the intended participant.
   </p>

    I never built the system but wish that I had because even looking back on it
now more than a decade later it seems like a good idea even if no one would
have used it except for me and my friends. There were plenty of mistakes in the
concept, like doing the networking with infrared, but all of them could be
readily fixed.
