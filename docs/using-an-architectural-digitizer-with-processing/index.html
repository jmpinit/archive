    Using an Architectural Digitizer with Processing

    My father is an architect which is how we ended up with an architectural plan
digitizer device gathering dust in our house. I thought it would be fun to use
as an input device. It had a serial interface but I didn't have the right cables
so I cracked the enclosure open and connected an Arduino to communicate with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't have documentation for the protocol that it used but thankfully it
volunteered data in a simple ASCII format. I made a simple Processing sketch
which parsed the data and painted a circle wherever I touched the digitizer's
pen to its surface.
