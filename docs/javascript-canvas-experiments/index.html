   <h2>
    Generating Space Invaders
   </h2>

   <p>
    Space invaders are easy and fun to generate randomly. Just generate random
pixels on one half and then mirror them.

    Pump Brain
   </h2>

   </p>
   <p>
    I was obsessed with evolutionary algorithms when I made this. It randomly
connected nodes into a graph and then the nodes could "pump" liquid between
them. I took the pump level at certain nodes as the "answer" to evaluate
against an arbitrary fitness function. And then I varied the layout of the
networks while evaluating their performance against the fitness function and
selecting the best performer as the graph layout to base the next generation
on. It never resulted in any very performant networks, but it was a fun
experiment.

    Spores
   </h2>

   </p>
   <p>
    Spores fall from the sky and grow flowers where they land.

   <h2>
    3D Sinewave Surface
   </h2>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="media/waves.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    I made this in high school when I was learning JavaScript. I was interested in
3D graphics and software renderers so I decided to try to make a simple point
renderer and do something interesting with it. I ended up drawing this simple
sinewave landscape from a rotating camera perspective using the simple trig that
I knew at the time.
