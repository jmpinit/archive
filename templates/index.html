        <p>An archive of projects, experiments, and creative dead-ends.</p>
        <p>
            As a creator most of my time is spent making "failures" which don't fulfill their desired goal. Nonetheless,
            it's work that is essential for learning how to engineer things that do work. It's also a form of unguided
            play that often leads to inspiration and helps turn over the bigger ideas that compose my understanding of
            what is interesting about the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you will find projects in many states - complete and incomplete. My hope is that you might
            find some idea, technique, or piece of information to salvage and use in your own creative works.
